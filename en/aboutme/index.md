# About Me


Welcome to my personal blog.

Here, I'll be sharing some of my experiences.

I hope that what I share can provide you with some inspiration or assistance.

# Who am I?

I'm a middle-aged man who has lived half of his life.

A member of the post-80s generation, Born in Suzhou, Studied in Nanjing, Worked in Beijing.

The first peak of my life has passed, And I'm currently in a low point. Whether it's the lowest point, I don't know yet.

I do what I can, And leave the rest to fate.

# What Can You Find Here?

I'll write about everything I've experienced and encountered here.

It will be quite eclectic, Whatever comes to mind gets written down.

Feel free to browse through categories and tags, Or use the search function.

See if there's anything that might be useful to you.

# Keep distance, stay connected.

To maintain the purity of the blog environment, I will not enable the comments system.

If you're interested in what I write, or have any questions that remain unanswered, Feel free to send me an email.

I'll gladly share everything I know that could help you.
